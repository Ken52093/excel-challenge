QUESTION:
1. Given the provided data, what are three conclusions we can draw about Kickstarter campaigns?
2. What are some limitations of this dataset?
3. What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

1.	
 a.	Based on the “Category Stats”, if I want to be successful on Kickstarter, I should launch a campaign related to theater, music, and film & video.
 i.	Within the film & video category, science fiction performs poorly. Meanwhile, documentary and short films are very successful.

 b.	According to the “Subcategory Stats”, if I want to be successful on Kickstarter, I should launch a campaign related to plays, rock, and documentary.
 i.	I would not recommend launching any campaigns related to food, because there are no successful projects in the food trucks or restaurant categories.

 c.	If I want to be successful on Kickstarter, I would launch my campaigns in May and avoid December, because of the trend spotted in “Outcomes based on Launch   
    Day”.

2.	The limitation of this dataset is the sample size of the data. I cannot make any definitive conclusion about Kickstarter projects launched based on the sample   
    size of 4,000 projects. 
    There are over 300,000 projects launched on Kickstarter, yet there are only 4,000 dataset analyzed here. 
    That is only 1.33% of all projects launched and therefore it is very difficult to say with any certainty that anything found in the data will lead to success.

3.	
 a.	By using the average donation, we could create a graph that shows earning potential per project per backer in each category, 
    because I want to know which category and subcategory people are willing to spend the most money on. 
 b.	I want to create a graph to show which projects were able to successfully raise the funding needed in the shortest amount of time. 
    I would first need to figure out how many days from the “Date Created Conversion” and the “Date Ended Conversion” per project and I need help with that.
